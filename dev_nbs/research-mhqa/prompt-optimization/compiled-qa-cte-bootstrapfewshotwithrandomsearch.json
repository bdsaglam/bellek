        "context": "# Hezekiah Augur\nAugur was born in New Haven, Connecticut. The son of a carpenter, he learned his trade as a woodcarver, carving table legs and other furniture ornament. Borrowing $2,000 from his father, he was invited to join a grocery store business venture. Three years later he discovered, to his shock and amazement, that not only was his money gone, but that he owed his partners $7,000. While thus engaged he invented a lace-making machine that lifted the financial burdens that he had assumed and thus allowed him to take up carving full-time. Around that time he also invented a machine for carving piano legs. He switched to marble later in his career, being among the first native born Americans to do so. Chauncey Ives studied briefly with Augug.\n\n# America-Lite\nAmerica-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) is a 2012 book by David Gelernter, published by Encounter Books.\n\n# David Gelernter\nDavid Hillel Gelernter (born March 5, 1955) is an American artist, writer, and professor of computer science at Yale University.
